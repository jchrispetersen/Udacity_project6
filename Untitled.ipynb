    "I started by investigating the fields and chosing how I wanted to present this information.  A few of these initial choices were around the organization of my story, and what types of graphs would convey my message in the most clear manner.  I thought bar charts and plots may work well.  I wanted to have an overview of the data, then move onto how the other factors impact performnace.  Based on this initial design, I created my first story.  I then showed this project to my wife for feedback, and based on her suggestions, I modified the color of the visuals, I moved 2 charts from the initial page to a newly created one for easier viewing and added labels for enhanced clarification.
